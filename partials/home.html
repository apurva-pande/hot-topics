                <p>According to an article from the Balance website written by Kimberly Amadeo on April 21, 2022, The value of money is determined by the demand for it, just like the value of goods and services. You can measure the value of money by what people will exchange for it and by how much of it there is."

                According to an article from Science Direct written by Rajesh Kumar in 2016, Time value of money The basic concept behind the time value of money is that an amount of money earned earlier is better than that earned tomorrow. The time value of money has immense application in today’s life. Its application spans a variety of personal decisions, like saving and retirement planning. Corporate investment decisions are based on the time value of money. A dollar earned today is worth more than a dollar earned tomorrow since the dollar can be invested to earn a return. For example, if the bank offers an annual interest rate of 10% on a savings account, one dollar deposited will become $1.10 in a year’s time. The time value of money exists due to inflation and the preference of people for present consumption. On account of inflation, you might not be able to buy the same amount of goods in the future compared to today as the purchasing power of money decreases due to inflation. People basically prefer present consumption to future consumption. Borrowers must offer compensation for the postponement of present consumption in the form of an interest rate on savings. This interest rate is called the real rate of interest. The nominal interest rate includes the real rate of interest and expected inflation. In the time value of money, money can be invested to earn a return, which is termed the discount rate."

                    According to an article published by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration on March 8, 2022, It is very likely you are eating foods and food products that are made with ingredients that come from GMO crops. Many GMO crops are used to make ingredients that Americans eat, such as cornflour, corn syrup, corn oil, soybean oil, canola oil, or granulated sugar. A few fresh fruits and vegetables are available in GMO varieties, including potatoes, summer squash, apples, papayas, and pink pineapples. Although GMOs are in a lot of the foods we eat, most of the GMO crops grown in the United States are used for animal food.<br>
                    To make it easier for consumers to know if the foods they eat contain GMO ingredients, the U.S. Department of Agriculture maintains a list of bioengineered foods available throughout the world. Additionally, you will start seeing the "bioengineered" label on some of the foods we eat because of the new National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard."

            <h2>The View of World in 2100</h2>

                <p> According to an article published on the Human Future of Work on September 3, 2020, As someone passionate about the future of work, I like to think about the future in different forms and shapes.
   
                  I don’t make predictions, as they are often incorrect and, therefore, useless. Besides, making exact predictions isn’t the point. When thinking about the future, we should consider what can or might happen and try to steer reality in the desired direction through our actions.
                 
                    Futures thinking allows us to identify the different possibilities and alternative realities offered to us by the future, so we can choose the one we like the most and try to build it. Futures thinking is the first step towards future building.
                  Scenarios and forecasts are more powerful tools than predictions.
               
                    They are not exact predictions, and it is understood that they may not happen as explained, but they allow us to get a glimpse of what different futures we might get to live in. I thoroughly enjoyed writing three possible scenarios about the future in 2050, which I called The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, or the fictional Possible Futures series. Will the future happen in any of these ways? No, I don’t think so, but we can still learn something from these stories.
            
                   Today I’d like to go a bit further and write about the world in 2100. I am not writing it as a scenario this time, but a series of small forecasts about different areas and how they may evolve in the next 80 years."
